# ðŸ“„ Model Card â€“ D501: Salary Classification (Census)

## Overview  
This model predicts whether an individual earns **â‰¤50K** or **>50K** annually using the UCI Census dataset (`data/census.csv`). It was developed as part of my **Machine Learning DevOps (D501) project**, where the focus was not only on training a model but also on building a **scalable, tested, and production-ready pipeline** with FastAPI.  

I approached this project with the mindset of:  
- Designing **clean, reproducible workflows**.  
- Documenting results transparently.  
- Making sure the model could be served as an API for real-world integration.

## Model Details  
- **Algorithm**: RandomForestClassifier  
  - Parameters: `n_estimators=200`, `random_state=42`  
- **Problem Type**: Binary classification  
- **Target Label**: `salary` (`<=50K` or `>50K`)  
- **Categorical Features Used**:  
  `workclass`, `education`, `marital-status`, `occupation`, `relationship`, `race`, `sex`, `native-country`

## Data  
- **Source**: Processed UCI Adult dataset (`data/census.csv`)  
- **Split**: 80% training, 20% test (stratified by target label for balance)  
- **Feature Engineering**:  
  - Applied `process_data()` for categorical encoding  
  - Used **one-hot encoding** for categorical features  
  - Label binarizer applied to `salary`

## Training & Evaluation  
- **Metrics (on hold-out test set):**  
  - Precision: **0.734**  
  - Recall: **0.636**  
  - F1-score: **0.682**  

These results suggest the model has a good balance between **precision** (not over-predicting >50K) and **recall** (catching most >50K cases).

## Slicing Metrics  
To test fairness and robustness, I evaluated slices on the feature `education`. Results showed variation:  
- Example:  
  - `education=Bachelors` â†’ Precision 0.746, Recall 0.771, F1 0.758  
  - `education=HS-grad` â†’ Precision 0.583, Recall 0.404, F1 0.477  

This confirmed the importance of monitoring **performance across subgroups** rather than relying only on aggregate metrics.  

---

## Limitations & Considerations  
- The dataset reflects **1990s U.S. census data**, so it may not generalize perfectly to todayâ€™s workforce.  
- Bias exists in real-world salary distribution across gender, race, and education â€” the model inherits those biases.  
- Precision and recall vary across subgroups, which highlights potential fairness issues.
